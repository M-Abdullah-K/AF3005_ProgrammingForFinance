Part 1: An interactive ipywidgets tool to check loan eligibility based on employment, income, and credit score. Loans are rejected for unemployment, low income (<50,000), or credit <650. Approved loans have 8% interest (650-750) or 5% (>750).

Part 2: An ipywidgets-based tool to classify a stock portfolioâ€™s risk level based on user-entered stock returns. High Risk if any stock has negative returns. Medium Risk if all are positive, but at least one is below 5%. Low Risk if all returns are 5% or above.

Part3: An ipywidgets-based tool to track loan repayment over time. Users enter the initial loan amount and fixed monthly payment, and the system calculates the remaining balance after each month until the loan is fully paid.

Part 4: An ipywidgets-based tool for tracking daily stock prices. Users input stock prices, the system skips missing data (None), prints daily prices, and triggers a "Sell" alert when the price reaches PKR 200.

Part 5: An ipywidgets-based tool that tracks daily exchange rate changes from PKR 290 to PKR 300. The rate increases by 1 PKR per day, displaying the updated exchange rate each day until it reaches the target.
